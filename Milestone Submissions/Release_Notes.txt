Last TA Meeting (11/17/2022):
- Had bugs with login, users could not login
- Had bugs with sorting in Discover page, could not sort by cook time: low to high
- "View Recipe" button on recipe cards were not functional
- Checkboxes unaligned on the "Add a recipe" modal
- Only features on the Profile page were "My favorite recipes" and "Add a recipe"

What's Changed (11/17/2022):
- Added a "My Recipes" feature to the Profile page
- Added a recipe page for each recipe
- Added "Edit recipe", "Delete recipe", "Remove favorite" features to the Profile page
- Fixed layout issues in the "Add a recipe" modal on the Profile page
- Fixed sorting bug on the Discover page

- Fixed the following APIs:
    - (GET) "/sort"
- Created the following APIs:
    - (GET) "view"
    - (POST) "/favorite_delete", "/recipe_delete", "edit"

- Users can now:
    - Click on "View Recipe" on each recipe card in the Discover Page to see recipe details on a new page
    - Remove a recipe from their Favorites on their Profile page
    - Successfully create, edit, and delete their own recipes from their Profile page
    - Sort recipes by cook time from lowest to highest on the Discover page
